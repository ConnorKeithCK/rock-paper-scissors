    <h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors!</h1>
    <p>Hello! This is my renditon of Rock, Paper, Scissors! created using JavaScript for my Web Game Development course.</p>
    <h1>How to play</h1>
    <p>This game is identical to the ever-loved game of Rock, Paper, Scissors! however it is played in a web browser rather than with your hands. This
        game is single-player, meaning you will be playing against the computer that will randomly select its move after you select yours. The goal of the game is simple, win each round!
        Here are the possible outcomes/moves:
        <ol>
        <li>Rock beats Scissors</li>
        <li>Paper beats Rock</li>
        <li>Scissors beats Paper</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
